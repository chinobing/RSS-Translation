<p>Hi Hacker Community,<p>That's my first post here so please be understanding<p>I'd appreciate your insights on my approach as a 27-year-old affiliate marketer with quite big for me switch in business carrier.<p>Over the past decade, I've been immersed in the marketing world, with preparation to one day creating a SaaS product rooted in my affiliate marketing experience.<p>Armed with a deep understanding of how affiliate marketing networks function and a burning curiosity about the Web3 realm, I delved into the distinctive world of marketing in this space.<p>Naturally, my primary interest lay within my field of expertise, affiliate marketing. I quickly realised that, in the present day, there are only a handful of players in the Web3 sphere that allow crypto projects to market their brands through affiliate marketing.<p>However, there's a catch.<p>If you're the creator of a crypto token, setting up a dedicated affiliate program for your token is, well, next to impossible. The traditional affiliate marketing framework doesn't quite fit the dynamics of the Web3 space.<p>And this is where things get interesting.<p>You see, if you, as a crypto project owner, wish to collaborate with a publisher or influencer, there's no surefire way to determine the precise outcome of this partnership. You can't measure the return on every dollar spent.<p>Let me break it down. When a publisher, like a crypto YouTuber, mentions your token as part of a partnership, they can't earn a single cent through an affiliate link.<p>Why, you ask?<p>It's because the end-user ultimately needs to make a purchase on a cryptocurrency exchange, and these platforms don't support affiliate links. Consequently, the publisher doesn't get the data back about how many users they brought in or how many sales were generated.<p>*These insights are crucial for crypto token creators to build valuable affiliate programs in any niche and make informed investment decisions in partnerships based on tangible results.*<p>So, about four months ago, I decided to dive headfirst into researching this issue.<p>That's when the idea struck: 
We needed a solution.<p>Thus, my business partners and I embarked on creating the world's very first affiliate network with FIAT-Enabled Affiliate Programs for Web3 Tokens.<p>Now, we're at the stage where we've developed a fully functional MVP. It includes:<p>- Automatically dedicated affiliate programs for crypto projects that want to collaborate with Parascale.
- A gateway for onboarding tokens and enabling publishers to create tracking links for specific tokens we partner with.
- Dashboards for publishers and advertisers (crypto token projects) with real-time insights into traffic, clicks, and sales.
- Comprehensive support for both publishers and advertisers, helping them amplify their marketing efforts and expand their horizons.<p>Me and my team would greatly appreciate your feedback on our MVP, which is currently live for beta testers, including both publishers and advertisers.<p>Your insights into our solution:<p>1. Firstly.. just what you generally think about it?<p>2. Website UX/UI (parascale.io)<p>3. Our demo affiliate landing page dedicated to every crypto projects would be invaluable (parascale.io/demo)<p>and perhaps you have some pearls of wisdom for a SaaS founder in a very niche market like me?<p>We're gearing up for our first integration with a crypto token in November and are eager to onboard more clients.<p>Thank you in advance for your time and wish you luck with your ventures!<p>Best,
Mac 
Co-founder Parascale</p>
